        <p class="steps">
            <strong>Step 1:</strong><br>Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir in the yeast and salt.
            Make a well, pour in 200ml warm water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden spoon until you have a
            soft, fairly wet dough. Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea
            towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.<br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong><br>Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to
            taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.<br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong><br>Roll out the dough: if you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split
            into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling
            pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking
            sheets.<br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong><br>Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an
            upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter
            with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of
            the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil
            leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.

        <p class="steps">
            <strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
            Prepare pizza dough through step 5, including preheating the oven to 475°F (246°C). Cover the shaped dough
            lightly with plastic wrap and allow it to rest as the oven preheats.<br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong><br>
            To prevent the pizza toppings from making your pizza crust soggy, brush the shaped dough lightly with olive oil.
            Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. Top the dough evenly with
            pizza sauce, then add the cheese, ham, pineapple, and bacon.<br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong><br>
            Bake pizza for 12-15 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with fresh basil, if desired. Slice hot pizza and
            serve immediately.<br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong><br>
            Cover leftover pizza tightly and store in the refrigerator. Reheat as you prefer. Baked pizza slices can be
            frozen up to 3 months. See pizza crust recipe for instructions on freezing the pizza dough.<br>

            <strong>Step 1:</strong><br>
            Add the flour and the dry baker's yeast to a large bowl — mix them together so they brewer's yeast is evenly
            dispersed in the flour.<br>
            <strong>Step 2:</strong><br>
            Meanwhile, dissolve the malt in warm water, add it to the bowl with the flour, together with olive oil and
            salt.<br>
            <strong>Step 3:</strong><br>
            Knead by hand until you get a smooth dough.<br>
            <strong>Step 4:</strong><br>
            Place the dough in a greased bowl, then cover it with cling film and store it in a warm spot for 3-4 hours, or
            until tripled in volume.<br>
            <strong>Step 5:</strong><br>
            Once risen, divide the dough in half, shape each half in a ball, roll them out into discs on a floured surface,
            then place each in a non-stick tray and let them rise for another hour.<br>
            <strong>Step 6:</strong><br>
            Once an hour has passed, sprinkle the pizza base with the four cheeses and black pepper.<br>
            <strong>Step 7:</strong><br>
            Bake in a 250°C/480°F oven, with the grill option turned on, for 15 minutes, until the pizza's edges are golden
            and its bottom dry.<br>
            <strong>Step 8:</strong><br>
            Once baked, serve immediately.<br>
